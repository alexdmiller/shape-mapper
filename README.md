# Shape Mapper

Shape Mapper is a [Processing](processing.org/) library for projection mapping.

## Use cases

[Projection mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_mapping) is the process of calibrating a digital projection to align with a three dimensional surface. The Shape Mapper library is useful if you have a 3D model of the object you want to projection map. Some example workflows:

- Create a model using 3D software such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), fabricate it with a 3D printer, and projection map it using Shape Mapper.
- Take precise measurements of an object and reconstruct it using 3D software such as Blender, then projection map it using Shape Mapper.
- Use Processing code to model a physical object, then projection map it using Shape Mapper (works well for simple primitives such as cubes).

If you do not have a 3D model of the object you are trying to projection map, or you are not able to create a model in code, this library will probably not be useful to you. It is still very much possible to projection map your object, though! Check out the [Keystone](https://github.com/davidbouchard/keystone) library for Processing, or software such as MadMapper, Resolume or TouchDesigner for alternative projection mapping solutions.

## Features

- Calibrate your projection by manually aligning at least 6 points; the mapping for the rest of the object will be automatically estimated.
- Supports mapping multiple shapes (i.e. if you have two or more separate objects).
- Supports multiple mappings per shape (i.e. if you have two or more projectors).
- Calibrations are saved to disk.
- Supports face masking, which allows you to avoid projecting twice onto the same face if using more than one projector.

## Non-features

Shape Mapper does not (yet) support:

- Blending between projectors
- Built in projection mapping effects (all effects must be drawn by the user with code)

## Credits & Acknowledgements

Shape Mapper is by [Alex Miller](https://alexmiller.cv/).

Shape Mapper is heavily inspired by and based on the [mapamok](https://github.com/YCAMInterlab/mapamok) library for [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/), originally developed by [Kyle McDonald](https://kylemcdonald.net/) as part of ProCamToolkit, co-developed by [YCAM Interlab](https://www.ycam.jp/en/aboutus/interlab/). It expands on the feature set of mapamok with multi-shape and multi-projection support.
